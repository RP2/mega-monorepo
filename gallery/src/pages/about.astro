      Riley is a fullstack web developer and photography enthusiast who enjoys
      walking around the Bay Area and capturing fleeting moments. This project
      was initially created as a way to showcase web development & design
      skills, but in the end, photography should be the primary focus. Riley is
      always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, he hopes that this
      project will inspire others to do the same.

      This website was built using Astro.js and the source code is <a
        class="font-bold hover:underline"
        href="https://github.com/RP2/mega-monorepo"
        rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
        target="_blank">open sourced and available on GitHub</a
      >. All the images in this gallery were taken by Riley, some with a film
      camera and others with a digital camera. Lately however, as the price of
      film and life itself continues to rise, more photos are likely to be
      digital.

    <p>I hope you enjoy this gallery, thank you for your time.</p>
